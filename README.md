## Get Your API Keys

Sign up at https://alpaca.markets and https://alphavantage.co to get your API keys. Users might want to copy and paste these to a note somewhere temporarily...

## Setup for config.js

Create a file called "config.js" in the same directory, and then copy and paste the following into it, making the necessary replacements in the keys object:

const keys = {
    'apiKey': 'your alpaca api key here',
    'secretKey': 'you alpaca secret key here',
    'alphaVantage': 'your alpha vantage api key here'
} 

## Dependencies

None, although this project depends heavily on jQuery
